\f0\fs24 \cf0 - If I made the FFT Magnitude a larger array, the program will still work properly, because rest of the parts will scale up based on the updated array size.\
- In general, pausing the audioManager would create a more "continuous" user experience (when user clicks back into the view it would continue the music). But a lot of times if the volume is only used in an app (for example a game) as the background music/white noise, it would be optimal to deallocate the audioManager object when the view has disappeared, so that it wouldn't hold a slice of resource and wait for the user to potentially use it again.}
